A Growl-like notification library. It's a bit different to most others
around, because:

* Only one message at a time. If you show another one, it displaces the current one.
  This avoids an ugly list of messages down the side.
* Messages auto-disappear, but you can also close them programmatically.
  Good for loading status.

Implementation is in CoffeeScript. For now, install CoffeeScript and
"coffee src/index.coffee" to build it.
